# TDL Logger 

Refactored version of logger.php that can be found in TDL SDK (https://jammerxd.com/).

In addition to the basic logger this can be used as API to the MySQL. Runs on Node.js as independent backend. This is good base and it can be easily used to create custom features, modern frontend or for example desktop logger software.
